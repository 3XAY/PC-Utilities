# PC Utilities

A one stop shop, portable app, just stick it on a USB drive and take it with you!
It's great for regular maintenance on a Windows 10 or 11 machine and even benchmarking.
It has Cinebench, HWInfo, CrystalDiskMark, CrystalDiskInfo, and Furmark installed by default.
The coolest part? It's written in Python, which means you don't need to be a rocket scientist to modify it.
You can even check out the [dev](DEV.md) file to see how you can modify it.
This software has been tested on Windows 11, but should work for Windows 10. If you wanna test it for me, please contact me [here](http://3xay.github.io/contact).

TLDR; __It's a collection of useful commands and apps for setting up, benchmarking, and maintaining PCs.__

## Installation
Simply download the **'PC-Utilities-Installer.exe'** file from the latest release, open it, and let it do its magic. <br>
It'll take ~5-10 minutes, so you should probably check out what everything does in the [wiki](https://github.com/3XAY/PC-Utilities/wiki). <br>
If you want to install it manually, check out the [File Structure](FileStructure.md) page to see how to format it.

## Helpful tips
If you are unsure on how to do something, **do not** attempt to do it. <br>
The application can be slow to launch on some computers, be patient. <br>
Some buttons may take some time to actually open up an application (especially Cinebench), be patient. <br>
